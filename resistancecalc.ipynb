    "Firstly, let's think why do things get hot when in a circuit? When we have a circuit, a current (which is made up of electrons) can flow through a material (which is made up of non-moving ions -> i.e. protons in a nucleus and other bound electrons). As the electrons move around the circuit, they can transfer some of their kinetic energy to ions. These ions are not free to move and can only vibrate on the spot â€“ this increase in vibrational energy is heat!"

    "It is important to realise that if we have a low resistance this will give us a large current (and so large heating of the resistor). We can understand this through Ohm's law and apply this to our circuit: $V=IR$, where $V$ is the voltage across resistor, $I$ is the current through the resistor and $R$ the resistance of the element. This tells us for a given supplied voltage, the current is inversely proportional to the resistance: a small resistance gives a large current (and hence lots of heating).\n",

    "* a current causes heating in a material as electrons transfer their energy to the vibrational energy of ions (which is heat).\n",
